<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- First code of every html file.
                It let the browser know we are using Html5. -->

<html> <!-- All code must be nested in the html tag. -->

    <head> <!-- Head tag gives the browser information to browser about page
           that are not meant for users.-->

        <meta charset="utf-8" /> <!-- Font -->

        <title>Title tag is also good for search engine!</title> <!-- Title tag put text in brower tab. -->

    </head>

    <body> <!-- All text on webpage will be in the body tag. -->

    <h1>This is how an h1 tag looks like!</h1>
    <h2>This is a h2 tag! It should be slightly smaller!</h2>
    <h6>Smallest heading tag!(h6)</h6>

    <p>This is a paragraph tag. It not actually long enough to be a paragraph though...</p>

    <p>A few styling que I learn for text is how to bold and italicized. One way is to use the b tag (bold)
     and the i tag (italicized), but those tags are out of date and are not recomended to be used.</p>

    <p>A better way is to use the <strong>strong</strong> or the <em>em</em> tags!</p>

    <br /> <!-- This should created a line break between the header and paragraph. -->

    <button>Useless button!</button>

    <ul> <!-- An unorder list! -->
        <li>Lots</li>
        <li>of</li>
        <li>Buttons</li>
        <li>Unorder List!</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>One</li>
        <li>two</li>
        <li>three</li>
        <li>four</li>
        <li>Order list!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Here a few extra things!</h3>
    <p>Not all tags need to have an ending tag. Some are self closing! Examples Below!</p>
